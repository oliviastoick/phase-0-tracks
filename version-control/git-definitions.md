# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? - Version control allows multiple users to work on the same document without changing the initial version or other users version. It is useful because they can easily be changed by multiple uses.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? - A branch is a copy of your project. I would use one when trying out different features that I may more may not merge back into the original project.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? - A commit means to save a code. A good commit cleary describes what you previously changed.
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when competing changes are made to the same line of a file or when a file is deleted that another person is trying to edit.
